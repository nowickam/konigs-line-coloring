# konigs-line-coloring

The program is a realization of the final assignment for Discrete Mathematics II course at the Warsaw University of Technology. It is an implementation of the proof for the KÅ‘nig's line coloring theorem (graph theory) in C++.

The outline of the reasoning, details of the application and implementation can be found at: [Konigs Line Coloring Theorem.pdf](https://github.com/nowickam/konigs-line-coloring/files/4117161/Konigs.Line.Coloring.Theorem.pdf).

The program is a simple console applciation with a hard-coded input of a regular, non-regular and random bipartite and connected graph, and edge colorings (list of colors with the indices of the vertices of the colored edge) on the output. 

Recognition:
The randomly generated graph might not conform to the preconditions of the algorithm (bipartite and connected) so the program does not generate colorings.
